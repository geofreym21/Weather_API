# What's the Weather Like?

## WeatherPy
A Python script that visualizes the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. A simple Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API was utilized in order to accomplish the said visualization, plus a little common sense that create a representative model of weather across world cities.

## Objective: to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
  •	Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  •	Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  •	Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  •	Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

## Final notebook must:
  •	Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
  
  •	Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
  
  •	Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
  
  •	Save both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.

## Final considerations:
  •	Analysis completed using a Jupyter notebook.
  
  •	Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries are used.
  
  •	Written description of three observable trends based on the data are included.
  
  •	Proper labeling of plots are observed, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
